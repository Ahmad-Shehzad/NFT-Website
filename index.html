        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <hr/>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>Welcome to iime. We are digital artists that create unique and exciting collections of NFTs, available on 
                <a href = "https://opensea.io/iime" target="_blank" class = "hyperlink">Opensea</a>.
                These collections are incredibly diverse and ground breaking. We started with the Spud Club, which was a 10
                piece collection of super cool spuds. Then, we went in a completely different direction and released Shapestract,
                a collection of 10,000 abstract pieces. This collection yielded our very first sale, #00016. Most recently, we have
                launched our most exciting collection to date, Sheep Shop. This flock of sheep were abandoned by their farmer, and we 
                are desperately trying to find them new homes, quite a task when there are 10,000 of them. We look forward to bringing 
                you more collections as soon as December.
            </p>

        <div class = "text">
            <p>You can purchase one of our NFTs by either clicking the link to our 
                <a href = "https://opensea.io/iime" target="_blank" class = "hyperlink">Opensea</a>
                account or by clicking on one of the collections above, taking you straight to the relevant 
                collection.Our NFTs are sold on the Polygon blockchain, this means there are no gas fees for 
                you to pay, just the cost of the NFT. You may wonder, "Why not use the Ethereum Blockchain?", 
                well besides the expense of gas fees, using the Ethereum blockchain has a big impact on our 
                carbon footprint hence, we opt to use Polygon.
